This program was created for the guru99 Python project:
https://www.guru99.com/live-python-project.html.

Each day for a week, participants would get an email from guru99 with the instructions for the day. Finally, we'd end up with a simple program designed to process a CSV file, analyze, visualize and extract data
from it, and to take care of some basic exception handling.

As I have yet a lot to learn about Python, the code I had ended up with was way too complex and redundant for my taste. Therefore, I decided to re-design in into an object-oriented one.

Anyway, as for my first project of this kind, I'm satisfied. However, I'm probably going to do a major overhaul of the get_input static method after a while.
